## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Diabetes_prediction_model.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model
The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and visualizing the features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and preparing it for the model.
3. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation metrics. Details of the results can be found in the notebook.
